# Demand Projection Regression Model

### Problem Statement
A large company in the food industry is facing challenges with the buy-back program for its products that have expired on retailers' shelves. The company wants to reduce operational costs and improve gross margins by accurately predicting the demand for various products in the next two weeks. As a data science consultant, your objective is to build a regression model that can forecast the demand projection.

### Dataset
The company has provided 5 weeks of historical data, including information about the products, their characteristics, and the corresponding demand. You will use this dataset to train and validate your regression model.

### Objective
Your main objectives for this hackathon are:
- Generate the target variable 'demand_projection' based on the available data.
- Build a machine learning or deep learning model that can accurately predict the demand projection for the test data.

### Evaluation Metric
The performance of your regression model will be evaluated based on the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). The lower the RMSE, the better the model's accuracy in predicting the demand projection.

### Repository Contents
- `notebooks/`: This folder contains Jupyter notebook with the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and test data predictions.
- `requirements.txt`: List of required dependencies. 

### Results
This regression model project aims to help the company accurately predict the demand for its products and make informed decisions on stock management.
